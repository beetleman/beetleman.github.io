# About Me

My name is Mateusz Probachta and I live in Kraków(Poland) and I coding stuff for a living. My adventure with code started almost 10 years ago and I really happy with this choice. I'm experienced in Python and JavaScript but my main coding passion is Clojure. I love the functional style of programming and I try to follow “Mutable state is the root of all evil” in any language/technology I working on.

I currently working for [Ocean] as a full-stack developer.

In my spare time I play in Diablo II, cooking vegan food and reading. I'm a fan of Sci-Fi and horror stories(mostly audiobook).
