# About Me (WIP)

My name is Mateusz Probachta and I live in Kraków(Poland) and I coding stuff for a living. My adventure with code started almost 10 years ago and I realy happy with this chooice. I'm experienced in Python and JavaScript but my main coding passion is Clojure. I love functional style of programing and I try to follow “Mutable state is the root of all evil” in any language/technology I working on.

I currently working for [PragmatiCoders][PC]. *[TODO: add few words about what I doing]*

In my spare time I plays in Diablo II, coking and reading. Im fan of Sci-Fi and horror stories(mostly audio book).
