# Why?

For frontend apps based on [React]/new-foo-framework-of-month, we are used to [HMR] its make development easier. On another hand, we still use nodaemon or manual restart for backend app. This solution work but destroy current state of the application during restart which can make debugging harder and startup of some apps is not a quick process.

# Solution

Luckily [neutrino] project provides the easy way to start [Node.js] project with enabled [HMR], [Jest], and [Babel] enabled by default. In this quick tutorial, I'll show how to setup project with [docker-compose] based development environment.

## create project

```shell
yarn create @neutrinojs/project nodeutrino
```

Answer few questions in order to setup project

- select application

```shell

## setup docker

As startup project from host machine is acceptable as development environment should we predictable and as close as possible to production. Both of this requirements are satisfied by docker. Save this file as `docker-compose.yml`:

```yml
version: "2.2"

services:
  app:
    image: node:8
    volumes:
      - ./:$PWD
    working_dir: $PWD
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    command: yarn start

  tests:
    extends: app
    command: yarn test
```

## run tests

```shell
docker-compose rm --rm tests
```

## run app

```shell
docker-compose up app
```

# The problem

HMR work out of box but if you make some syntaxt error you will need restart aplication

```shell
echo "the bug!" >> src/app.js
```

and you get something like:

```shell
app_1    | [HMR] Cannot apply update.
app_1    | [HMR] Error: Module build failed: SyntaxError: Unexpected token, expected ; (6:4)
app_1    |
app_1    |   4 |
app_1    |   5 | export default app;
app_1    | > 6 | the bug
app_1    |     |     ^
app_1    |   7 |
app_1    |
app_1    |     at Object../src/app.js (/home/beetleman/Projects/nodeutrino/build/0.c485d22b6ea60c2a147d.hot-update.js:8:7)
app_1    |     at __webpack_require__ (/home/beetleman/Projects/nodeutrino/build/index.js:639:30)
app_1    |     at fn (/home/beetleman/Projects/nodeutrino/build/index.js:49:20)
app_1    |     at /home/beetleman/Projects/nodeutrino/build/index.js:855:108
app_1    |     at hotApply (/home/beetleman/Projects/nodeutrino/build/index.js:542:17)
app_1    |     at /home/beetleman/Projects/nodeutrino/build/index.js:250:21
app_1    |     at <anonymous>
app_1    | [HMR] You need to restart the application!
```

It is rly anoying during development but lucky solution for this is quite simple. We need wrap our
`import` statment in `try catch` block. To achieve this goal we create `HMRApp.js`:

```javascript
/* eslint-disable */
let app;
try {
  app = require('./app').default;
} catch (err) {
  console.error(err);
  app = () => err.message;
}
export default app;
```

and then replace `./app` with `./HMRApp` in `index.js`:

```javascript
 import { createServer } from 'http';
import app from './HMRApp';

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

createServer((request, response) => response.end(app()))
  .listen(port, () => process.stdout.write(`Running on :${port}\n`));

if (module.hot) {
  module.hot.accept('./HMRApp');
}
```

 after restarting app you should get:

 ```shell
app_1    | yarn run v1.5.1
app_1    | $ neutrino start
app_1    | Error: Module build failed: SyntaxError: Unexpected token, expected ; (6:4)
app_1    |
app_1    |   4 |
app_1    |   5 | export default app;
app_1    | > 6 | the bug
app_1    |     |     ^
app_1    |   7 |
app_1    |
app_1    |     at Object../src/app.js (/home/beetleman/Projects/nodeutrino/build/index.js:848:7)
app_1    |     at __webpack_require__ (/home/beetleman/Projects/nodeutrino/build/index.js:639:30)
app_1    |     at fn (/home/beetleman/Projects/nodeutrino/build/index.js:49:20)
app_1    |     at Object../src/HMRApp.js (/home/beetleman/Projects/nodeutrino/build/index.js:836:9)
app_1    |     at __webpack_require__ (/home/beetleman/Projects/nodeutrino/build/index.js:639:30)
app_1    |     at fn (/home/beetleman/Projects/nodeutrino/build/index.js:49:20)
app_1    |     at Object../src/index.js (/home/beetleman/Projects/nodeutrino/build/index.js:859:66)
app_1    |     at __webpack_require__ (/home/beetleman/Projects/nodeutrino/build/index.js:639:30)
app_1    |     at fn (/home/beetleman/Projects/nodeutrino/build/index.js:49:20)
app_1    |     at Object.0 (/home/beetleman/Projects/nodeutrino/build/index.js:876:1)
app_1    | Running on :3000
 ```

 and now you can remove `the bug` and enjoi HMR!

 ```shell
app_1    |     at __webpack_require__ (/home/beetleman/Projects/nodeutrino/build/index.js:639:30)
app_1    |     at fn (/home/beetleman/Projects/nodeutrino/build/index.js:49:20)
app_1    |     at Object.0 (/home/beetleman/Projects/nodeutrino/build/index.js:876:1)
app_1    | Running on :3000
app_1    | [HMR] Updated modules:
app_1    | [HMR]  - ./src/app.js
app_1    | [HMR]  - ./src/HMRApp.js
app_1    | [HMR] Update applied.
 ```

Of course implementation of `HMRApp.js` depends on how `app.js` is implemented bu basic idea is that if import throw exception replace if with mock of `app` and print error on `strerr`.

Implementation of example app is avialable in github [repo].

Happy hacking ‚ù§Ô∏è!
